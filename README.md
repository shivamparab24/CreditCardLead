# CreditCardLeadPredicton
Credit card lead prediction using machine learning models to identify the best possible model for predicting customer interest in cross-sell opportunities. 


This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning project aimed at predicting potential leads for credit card offers. The project utilises various classification algorithms to identify individuals who are likely to respond positively to credit card marketing efforts.

The project successfully identified potential credit card leads with high accuracy and balanced performance across multiple evaluation metrics. The Random Forest Classifier was chosen as the final model due to its superior performance.
